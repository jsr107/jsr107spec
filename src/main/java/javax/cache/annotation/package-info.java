/**
 * The annotations in this package provide method interceptors for user supplied
 * classes.
 *
 * In the case of a the {@link javax.cache.annotation.CacheResult} annotation,
 * if the cache can satisfy the request a result is returned by the method from
 * cache, not from method execution. For the mutative annotations such as
 * {@link javax.cache.annotation.CacheResult} the annotation allows the cached
 * value to be mutated so that it will be correct the next time
 * {@link javax.cache.annotation.CacheResult} is used.
 * <p/>
 * Any operations against a cache via an annotation will have the same behaviour
 * as if the {@link javax.cache.annotation.CacheResult} methods were used. So
 * if the same underlying cache is used for an annotation and a direct API call,
 * the same data would be returned. Annotations therefore provide an additional
 * API for interacting with caches.
 * <p/>
 * In order to use these annotations, you'll need a library or framework which
 * processes these annotations and intercepts calls to your application objects
 * to provide the caching behaviour. This would commonly be provided by a
 * dependency injection framework such as defined by CDI in Java EE.
