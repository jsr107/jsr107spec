/**
 * A {@link Cache} is a Map-like data structure that provides temporary storage

 * <ol>
 * <li>store key-value pairs, each referred to as an {@link Entry}</li>
 * <li>allow use Java Generics to improve application type-safety</li>
 * <li>are {@link Iterable}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link Map}s, {@link Cache}s
 * <ol>
 * <li>do not allow null keys or values.  Attempts to use <code>null</code>
 * will result in a {@link NullPointerException}</li>
 * <li>provide the ability to read values from a
 * {@link CacheLoader} (read-through-caching)
 * when a value being requested is not in a cache</li>
 * <li>provide the ability to write values to a
 * {@link CacheWriter} (write-through-caching)
 * when a value being created/updated/removed from a cache</li>
 * <li>provide the ability to observe cache entry changes</li>
 * <li>may capture and measure operational statistics</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * A simple example of how to use a cache is:
 * <pre><code>
 * String cacheName = "sampleCache";
 * CachingProvider provider = Caching.getCachingProvider();
 * CacheManager manager = provider.getCacheManager();
 * Cache&lt;Integer, Date&gt; cache = manager.getCache(cacheName, Integer.class,
 *                                                     Date.class);
 * Date value1 = new Date();
 * Integer key = 1;
 * cache.put(key, value1);
 * Date value2 = cache.get(key);
 * </code></pre>
