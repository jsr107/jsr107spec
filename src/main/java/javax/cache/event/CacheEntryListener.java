/**
 * A tagging interface for cache entry listeners.
 * <p>
 * Sub-interfaces exist for the various cache events allowing a listener to be
 * created which implements only those listeners it is interested in.
 * <p>
 * Listeners should be implemented with care. In particular it is important to
 * consider their impact on performance and latency.
 * <p>
 * Listeners:
 * <ul>
 * <li>are fired after the entry is mutated in the cache</li>
 * <li>if synchronous are fired, for a given key, in the order in which events
 * occur</li>
 * <li>block the calling thread until the listener returns,
 * where the listener was registered as synchronous</li>
 * <li>which are asynchronous iterate through multiple events with an undefined
 * ordering, except that events on the same key are in the order in which the
 * events occur.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Listeners follow the observer pattern. An exception thrown by a
 * listener does not cause the cache operation to fail.
 * <p>
 * Listeners can only throw {@link CacheEntryListenerException}. Caching implementations
 * must catch any other {@link Exception} from a listener, then wrap and rethrow it as a
 * {@link CacheEntryListenerException}.
 * <p>
 * A listener which mutates a cache on the CacheManager may cause a deadlock.
 * Detection and response to deadlocks is implementation specific.
