/**
 * A CompletionListenerFuture is a CompletionListener implementation that
 * supports being used as a Future.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * <pre><code>
 * //create a completion future to use to wait for loadAll
 * CompletionListenerFuture future = new CompletionListenerFuture();
 * 
 * //load the values for the set of keys, replacing those that may already exist
 * //in the cache
 * cache.loadAll(keys, true, future);
 * 
 * //wait for the cache to load the keys
 * future.get();
 * </code></pre>
 * <p/>
 * A CompletionListenerFuture may only be used once.  Attempts to use an instance
 * multiple times, as part of multiple asynchronous calls will result in an
 * {@link java.lang.IllegalStateException} being raised.
