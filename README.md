Maven snippet:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
      <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
      <version>0.10</version>
    </dependency>


Snapshot Releases
-----------------

Snapshot releases of jars for binaries, source and javadoc are available.

Download the cache-api from <https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~javax-cache>

or use the following Maven snippet:

    <repository>
        <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
        <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>javax.cache</groupId>
      <artifactId>cache-api</artifactId>
      <version>0.12-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Javadoc
-------

The JavaDoc is available as a jar with the releases. We also have the latest JavaDoc [online](https://jsr107.ci.cloudbees.com/job/jsr107api/ws/target/apidocs/index.html).

Specification
-------------

The specification is available online on as a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZ-lrH6nW871Vd9Z34Og_EqbX_kxxJi55UrSn4yL2Ak/edit?hl=en_US).

Reference Implementation
------------------------

The reference implementation ("RI") source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsr107/RI).

This implementation is not meant for production use. For that we would refer you to one of the many open source and commercial
implementations of JCache.

The RI is there to ensure that the specification and API works.

For example, some things that we leave out:

- tiered storage. A simple on-heap store is used.
- replicated or distributed caching

Why did we do this? Because a much greater engineering effort, which gets put into the open source and commercial caches
which implement this API, is required to accomplish these things.

Having said that, the RI is Apache 2 and is a correct implementation of the spec. It can be used to create new cache
implementations.

Building From Source
--------------------

Building uses Maven in all modules. Maven 2.2.1 and 3.0.4 have been tested.

See each module's README.md for build instructions.

Please add the following to your settings.xml to enable the CDI RI to be sucked down from JBoss.

Continuous Integration
----------------------
All modules are built at http://jsr107.ci.cloudbees.com.


Testing Implementions of JSR107
-------------------------------

The jsr107tck module contains a domain, tests and an implementation-tester. The implementation-tester allows an implementation, packaged
as a Maven module, to be specified on the command line and tested. For example a fictional Acme company implementation could be tested as follows:

    mvn -Dtest=CacheManagerFactoryTest \
        -Dimplementation-groupId=acme.cache \
        -Dimplementation-artifactId=acme-cache \
        -Dimplementation-version=0.1-SNAPSHOT \
        test
